# php-stdlib

This is very much alpha, work in progress, etc. The goal is to demonstrate how to use some patterns from Go's stdlib in PHP 8, particularly the io.Writer interface and net/http package.

See the developing [API example](examples/basicAPI/) for now. You can run :

```
composer install
php examples/basicAPI/runcli.php
```
